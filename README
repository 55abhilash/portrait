-------------------------------- PORTRAIT ----------------------------------

Portrait aims to be a completely free, easy to deploy systems management software.

It is built on top of the remote execution software salt stack.

INSTALLATION : 

Dependencies for running portrait are :-
python-django, salt-*, mysql / mariadb

1) Clone the project / Download the zip and extract. <br>
2) In the project directory, open portrait/settings.py.
   There is a dictionary variable called DATABASES <br>

   Change it to these values :-

	DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'portrait',
        'USER': '', #database root username here 
        'PASSWORD': '',# database password here
        'HOST': '', # Specify host and port 
        'PORT': '', # if your database runs on another machine
    		}
	}

3)  After making the above changes, go to project root directory and do :-
		
		python manage.py makemigrations
		python manage.py migrate

Both as sudo user.

4) As temporarily I am trying to run this on port 80, disable apache

		sudo service apache2 stop

4) Run the server in the project root directory :
	
		python manage.py runserver hostname:80

Eg. python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80   # for localhost
